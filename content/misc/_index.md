# Kendo

Kendo (剣道) is a Japanese martial art that literally translates to "the way of the sword". While derived from kenjutsu, which historically used katana, kendo is practiced using bamboo swords (shinai)  and protective armor (bogu) for sparring and competition.

I started kendo in 2017 with the University of Waterloo Kendo Club and stayed there until my graduation from my Master's in 2021. Since 2021, I have been a member of the Kingston Kendo Club.
