# Welcome!

I am a second year MMath student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, working with [Dr. Ghazal Geshnizjani](https://ghazalgeshnizjani.wordpress.com/). I also did my BMath at the University of Waterloo as well, with a major in Mathematical Physics. This site is currently a work in progress, but please feel free to look around.
